About
------
PyMTP is a Pythonic binding to LibMTP that allows Python programs to interact
over Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) with LibMTP-supported devices. These devices
include all recent Android devices, several popular MP3 players, including
Creative Zen, several iRiver devices, NormSoft Pocket Tunes and many others.

Why
----
I decided to write pymtp after I got my Creative(R) Zen V Plus, and I noticed
there wasn't any libraries to use MTP in python. I grabbed ctypes and went to 
work. 

Requirements
------------
pymtp 0.0.5 requires:
	* python
	* ctypes (or Python 2.5, as it includes Ctypes)
	* libmtp 1.1 or above

Installing
-----------
To install pymtp on most systems, run setup.py:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install
	
After running those commands (on *nix, you'll need to run the install command 
as root), pymtp should be installed and ready to go

Generating documentation
------------------------
While pymtp doesn't come with any documentation with it, you can generate 
documentation using epydoc. Epydoc makes very pretty documentation:

	epydoc -o <output directory> pymtp.py
	
This, of course, requires epydoc to be installed.

Getting help
-------------
If you find you need help getting pymtp working, or have any questions or 
comments on pymtp, please send me a message. I'm usually available on 
irc.freenode.net as "nick125", or email me at nick@nick125.com

Thanks
------
I would like to take this moment to thank everyone who has ever filed a bug
report or a patch. You guys have made me feel like my work is actually 
important to someone and have given me the encouragement to keep working on it.
I'd like to give a special thanks to Dan O'Reilly for his patches and other
contributions to this project.
